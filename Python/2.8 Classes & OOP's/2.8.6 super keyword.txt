The super() keyword in Python is used to refer to the parent class. 
It is especially useful when a class inherits from multiple parent classes and you want to call a method from one of the parent classes.

ex:

class ParentClass:
    def parent_method(self):
        print("This is the parent method.")

class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    def parent_method(self):
        print("This is the child's parent method.")

    def child_method(self):
        print("This is the child method.")
        super().parent_method()

child_object = ChildClass()
child_object.child_method()

=>
This is the child method.
This is the parent method.







For passing values to parent's constructor:

class Employee:
  def __init__(self, name, id):
    self.name = name
    self.id = id

class Programmer(Employee):
  def __init__(self, name, id, lang):
    super().__init__( name, id)
    self.lang = lang

harry = Programmer("Harry", "2345", "Python")
