Static methods in Python are methods that belong to a class rather than an instance of the class. They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator.
But we can also call it on an instance of the class.


class Sample:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b
    
result = Sample.add(1, 2)
print(result)

s = Sample()
result = s.add(3, 5)
print(result)
