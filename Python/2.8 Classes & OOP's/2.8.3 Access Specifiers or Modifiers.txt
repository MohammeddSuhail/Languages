Public:
All the variables and methods (member functions) in python are by default public. 
Any instance variable in a class followed by the ‘self’ keyword ie. self.var_name are public accessed.




Private(__varname): can still be accessed indirectly.
In Python, there is no strict concept of "private" access modifiers like in some other programming languages. 
However, a convention has been established to indicate that a variable or method should be considered private by prefixing its name with a double underscore (__).




Protected: Just a convention
In Python, the convention for indicating that a member is protected is to prefix its name with a single underscore (_).
