note: When imported that module will be executed

import math
result = math.sqrt(9)


from math import sqrt
result = sqrt(9)


from math import sqrt, pi


from math import *


import math as m





The dir function:
Finally, Python has a built-in function called dir that you can use to view the names of all the functions and variables defined in a module. This can be helpful for exploring and understanding the contents of a new module.

import math
print(dir(math))








__name__:
 __name__ variable is a built-in variable that is automatically set to the name of the current module. 
When a Python script is run directly, the __name__ variable is set to the string __main__ 
When the script is imported as a module into another script, the __name__ variable is set to the name of the module.


ex:
def func():
    print("Running script directly")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func()

execute the function only if it is directly run.


ex:
def main():
    print("Running script directly")
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
